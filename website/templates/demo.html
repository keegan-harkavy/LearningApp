                    Meet George, George is a 2nd grader struggling with how to pronounce certain words. 
                    George really likes Star Wars and knows the names of every character in the franchise. 
                    Help George learn to read by selecting the characters that correspond to each part of the word. 
                    If you can't remember who a certain character represents, ask George; he is sure to know them all.
                </p>

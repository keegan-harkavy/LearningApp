Carey is probably right and trying to do this with grammar is kind of stupid -- maybe simple sentences but simple sounds doesn't 
make a lot of sense. What is the peer teaching, it is almost to basic too teach. 

Goal - Students use chat gpt and other genarative AI to create a virtual assitent that can they can teach how to say certain words 

Questions? 
    - How is the Ai going to learn?
    - How are we going to track the student teaching?
    - If the student has a hard time reading and writing, how are they going to teach the Ai? 
    - What will the website look like?
    - What will even the demo look like?

Anwsers? 
    - We would probably need to do this ALL in text to speech, assume the student can't read or write (this sounds hard)
    - Prehapse we get the student to just correct the AI? We will present the AI with some cards, the AI will attempt to read them
    and the student has to responded with if they are good or bad ideas. 
    - Going with our orginal 


What I am trying to do in this code:
    - All this will take place in Demo (maybe not sure how the HTML works yet)
    - User meets George 
    - User is prompted with some basic sounds matched with some images from Star Wars 
        - this should be hard coded for the demo but could eventually be left to GAI 
            - Maybe the user selects a broad catagory, then lots of code to find image that corrosponds to each 
            sound used in English. Not sure how we would check this. -- see below for some more ideas 
    - George then asked how do you say ______
        - This I imagine will be a hard coded dictionary 
    - User is provided with 5 choices (maybe more or less), they must select the 3 (in order) that corrospond to how to say the word 
        - Would love this to be quite dynamic with a nice slidely animated function, again no idea how to code this but
        can probably figure out 
    - George then attempts to read the word 
        - Would love to use text to speech for this, no idea how the API works - will have to learn 
    - If you are right George will read the word correctly if you are wrong you will be prompted to try again
    - Repeat 
        - Keep stats? High scores? Other data? 
This all works and may be useful but does it have enough peer tutoring and GAI???





What we could do instead:
    Create a peer tutoring app: (This is basically what I said above)
        - Idea 
            - The app will let you pick a catagory, 
            - then will generate images for each sound, 
            - then will display images and ask for sound that corrisponds with said image. 
            - Then some speech regonition will say if your right or wrong 
        - Pros:
            - While not "easy" this is very doable 
                - Basic framework 
                    - Screen 1:
                        * Enter a franchise you like 
                        * Auto generate images for each sound from this franchise 
                        * let the student pick certain sounds that they don't like and have them change the sounds 
                        * have the students save there "deck" of sounds and photos 
                            - Assume we can do this using a sql file and labeling created photos 
                    - Screen 2:
                        * Display a photo 
                        * Have the student say the words outloud
                        * Display wether they got it right or wrong 
                        * repeat 
            - Would probably be pretty useful 
        - Cons:
            - Is not a great use of genarative AI 
            - Is not peer tutoring 
    Pivot away from basic sounds to maybe grammar and math
        -Idea (this is what we had before)
            - Pick a topic 
            - Have GAI ask a question about somthing they don't understand 
            - Have us explain that idea 
            - Have the GAI ask follow up questions 
            - Repeat until some check says they are right??? 



More thoughts:
    I make it impossible to update franchise. Do we want to change this?
    Big error -- I am storing the created images locally, then checking to see if these images exist for wether or not to regenerate 
    the images. What this means is that a new account won't be prompted to regenerate image. Need to fix. 
    Also it seems there are errors changing users, probably introduced on my end 
    Very buggy at the moment so will need to fix that
        * Most regenerate buttons work but not all 
        * if you have all ready generated a flash card you are still prompted to try again which causes problems.
